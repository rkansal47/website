title: Graph GAN
summary: Leading the effort on developing a graph-based GAN, which has proven effective at generating sparse data with irregular underlying geometry. Our first results were accepted as a poster at the Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2020. We're now experimenting with a conditional GAN version and variable-sized graphs, as well as applications to other datasets such as LHC calorimeter data.
