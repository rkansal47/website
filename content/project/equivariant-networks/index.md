Developed a graph-based autoencoder (PGAE) for compression of and anomaly detection in Large Hadron Collider data. 
Wrote a review of deep learning models that are equivariant to physics-relevant group transformations for the UCSD group theory course.
Led to developing a graph-based autoencoder equivariant to Lorentz group transformations as well (LGAE).
LGAE outperformed CNN and GNN autoencoders for compression and anomaly detection tasks.
