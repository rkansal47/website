title: Lorentz Group Equivariant Autoencoders
summary: Wrote a review of deep learning models that are equivariant to physics-relevant group transformations for Prof. John McGreevy's fantastic group theory course. This led to our group developing a graph-based autoencoder equivariant to Lorentz group transformations (LGAE). Our first paper is out now!
