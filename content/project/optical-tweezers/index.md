title: Optical Tweezers and a Quantum Gas Microscope
summary: Created dynamic, sub-micron holographic optical tweezers and a Quantum Gas Microscope with sub-micron resolution in order to manipulate individual atoms (or qubits) for quantum computing and quantum information science experiments. This work won a William A. Lee Research award, and will be published soon.
