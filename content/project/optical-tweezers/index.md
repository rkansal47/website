title: Optical Tweezers and a Quantum Gas Microscope
summary: I created dynamic, sub-micron holographic optical tweezers and a Quantum Gas Microscope with sub-micron resolution in order to manipulate individual atoms (or qubits) for quantum computing and quantum information science experiments. This work won a William A. Lee Research award, and will be published soon.

The goal of this project was to be able to control individual atoms (or qubits) for quantum computing and quantum information science experiments. In order to do so I:
- generated 2D dynamic, arbitrarily arranged, sub-micron optical tweezers using holography and acousto-optic deflectors, for manipulating individual (or small groups of) neutral atoms
- and then designed and built the setup for a quantum gas microscope (QGM) to image the atoms and tweezers with single-site resolution.

This project involved
- designing and building the necessary optical setups
- programming FPGA and C electronic devices for controlling the deflectors
- creating and (3D) printing mechanical mounts and electronics circuits
- writing the algorithms for holography and dynamically arranging tweezers
