title: Equivariant Neural Networks
summary: Wrote a review of deep learning models that are equivariant to physics-relevant group transformations for Prof. John McGreevy's fantastic group theory course. Our group (ha!) is now looking into applications of Lorentz group equivariant models to generation - stay tuned for more updates on this!
