title: Equivariant Neural Networks
summary: Wrote a review of current work on deep learning models that are equivariant to group transformations relevant to physics for my fantastic group theory course. Our group is now looking into applications of Lorentz group equivariant models to generation - stay tuned for more updates on this!
