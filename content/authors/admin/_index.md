I'm Raghav, a PhD candidate at the University of California, San Diego, and part of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

I work on creating/applying machine learning models for/to particle physics. I am particularly interested in generative models for simulating particle collisions, as well as more generally using ML for improving data collection, reconstruction, and analysis. In the past I have worked in experimental quantum information science/AMO as well as in the intersection between neuroscience and physics.
