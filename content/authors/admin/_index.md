I'm Raghav, a PhD candidate at the University of California, San Diego and also part of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 

I work on creating/applying machine learning models for/to particle physics. I am particularly interested in generative models for simulating particle collisions, as well as generally using ML for improving data collection, reconstruction, and analysis.
