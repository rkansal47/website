Hi, I'm a high energy physics (HEP) PhD candidate at UCSD ([Duarte Lab](https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu/)), on the [CMS](https://cms.cern) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and 2021-22 Fermilab LPC [Artificial Intelligence Fellow](https://lpc.fnal.gov/programs/ai-fellowships/2021/Raghav_Kansal.shtml).

I'm developing geometric deep generative models for LHC simulations ([MPGAN](https://github.com/rkansal47/MPGAN)), and as part of my AI fellowship I'm thinking about how to implement these for CMS. 

I'm also searching for di-Higgs events, and have developed a state-of-the-art geometric deep learning classifier for this. 

Finally, I have a number of computational side projects I work and mentor students on, including [equivariant neural networks](/project/lorentz-group-autoencoder/), [geometric deep learning for anomaly detection](/project/graph-ae/), and the [JetNet](/project/jetnet/) package for ML in HEP.
