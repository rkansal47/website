I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, San Diego and am part of the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. 

My research focuses on creating/applying machine learning models for/to particle physics. I am particularly interested in generative models for simulating particle collisions, as well as collaborating with people around the world on improving data collection, reconstruction, and analysis using ML.
