Hi, I'm a Schmidt / AI postdoctoral fellow with a joint appointment at Caltech and Fermilab. I work on the [CMS](https://cms.cern) experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider on expanding our discovery potential in particle physics with AI. 

<!-- ![Logos](/uploads/logos.png) -->


I completed my PhD at UC San Diego, where I worked on [deep generative models for particle physics simulations](/project/fast-sim/), [searches for highly energetic Higgs boson pairs](/project/higgs) using AI, [equivariant neural networks](/project/equivariant-networks/) for model-independent searches, and [more](https://www.raghavkansal.com/projects/).

<!-- 
I'm developing deep generative models for LHC simulations ([MPGAN](https://github.com/rkansal47/MPGAN)); 
I was awarded the Fermilab [Artificial Intelligence Fellowship](https://lpc.fnal.gov/programs/ai-fellowships/2021/Raghav_Kansal.shtml) in 2021 to implement these for CMS. 

I'm also searching for double-Higgs events and new particles, which involves developing a geometric deep learning classifier for Higgs to WW jets. 

Finally, I have a number of computational side projects I work and mentor students on, including [equivariant neural networks](/project/equivariant-networks/), [explainable AI](/project/explainable-ai/), and the [JetNet](/project/jetnet/) package for ML in HEP.  -->
