  - title: Machine Learning + Particle Physics Researcher
    company: Duarte Lab, UC San Diego
    company_url: 'https://jduarte.physics.ucsd.edu'
    location: San Diego, USA
    date_start: '2019-09-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: |
        * Developing new graph generative models for sparse and irregular data like that in particle physics
        * Using new deep graph neural network classifiers to set the most stringent constraints to date on double-Higgs production, allowing insight into the metastability of the universe
  - title: CERN Openlab Intern
    company: Machine Learning for Particle Physics Group, CERN
    company_url: 'https://cern.ch'
    location: Geneva, Switzerland
    date_start: '2019-06-01'
    date_end: '2019-08-01'
    description: |
        * Started our project on graph generative models for particle physics simulations, motivated primarily by the CMS experiment's new High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL)
  - title: Experimental Quantum Information Science Researcher
    company: Barreiro Lab, UC San Diego
    company_url: 'https://barreirolab.com'
    location: San Diego, USA
    date_start: '2017-06-01'
    date_end: '2019-06-01'
    description: |
        * Designed and implemented a setup for a quantum gas microscope (QGM) to image with single-site resolution
        * Generated 2D dynamic, arbitrarily arranged, sub-micron optical tweezers, integrated with the QGM, via two methods, using: 1) a Digital Micromirror Device (i.e. holography), and 2) an acousto-optic deflector
        * Characterized a high (0.8) Numerical Aperture objective for the QGM using OSLO optical simulations and point-spread function image analysis in Python
        * Using an FPGA device, outputted RF waveforms that modulate laser beams with parabolic spatial intensity in order to produce a Bose-Einstein Condensate
        * Programmed FPGA and C electronic devices, and created and (3D) printed mechanical mounts and electronics circuits for experimental use
  - title: Neurophysics Researcher
    company: Kleinfeld Lab, UC San Diego
    company_url: 'https://neurophysics.physics.ucsd.edu'
    location: San Diego, USA
    date_start: '2018-09-01'
    date_end: '2019-06-01'
    description: |
        * Used two-photon microscopy to measure pO2 in the mouse somatosensory cortex
        * Imaged the cortex to measure vasomotion relative to pO2
  - title: Software Intern
    company: Focus Analytics
    company_url: 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/retailnav/about/'
    location: Mumbai, India
    date_start: '2016-07-01'
    date_end: '2016-09-01'
    description: |
        * Interned at a software startup which has since been bought by Moka
        * Developed and deployed a location prediction SparkJava server with Cassandra and Redis databases
        * Implemented ML k-means clustering and SVM linear classification algorithms on location data
        * Wrote NodeJS servers and pages for receiving usersâ€™ predicted locations and displaying the live data on maps
        * Designed Cassandra and MySQL databases storing user tracking data, and wrote server APIs for accessing/updating, along with web panels for easy viewing of the data (using said APIs)
