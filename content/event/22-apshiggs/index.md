summary: ''
abstract: "We present developments in a search for boosted (pT > 250 GeV) Higgs boson pair production, where one Higgs decay to bb quarks and the other to two vector bosons in the all-hadronic final state. Using data collected by the CMS experiment in 2016â€”2018, corresponding to 137 inverse femtobarns, we show an expected upper limit on HH pair production using a cut-based analysis and a newly developed H(WW) graph neural network tagger. Such an analysis can provide insight into the trilinear Higgs self-coupling as well as the vector-boson-Higgs couplings."
