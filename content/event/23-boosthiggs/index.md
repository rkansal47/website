summary: ''
abstract: "Characterising double-Higgs production has been a major part of the LHC physics program in Run 2 and beyond. We discuss new techniques and results in boosted, hadronic final states in CMS, with a focus on wide-radius jet taggers and data-driven multi-jet background estimation, as well as measurements of gluon-gluon- and vector-boson-fusion HH production in the 4 beauty quark final state in 138fb^-1 of data at √s = 13 TeV, which observed (expected) a cross section of 9.9 (5.1) relative to the SM prediction and excluded the quartic VVHH coupling κ2V = 0 for the first time. Finally, we look ahead to possible new final states and improvements to triggers and techniques in Run 3."
