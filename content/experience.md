              * Designed and implemented a setup for a quantum gas microscope (QGM) to image with single-site resolution
              * Generated 2D dynamic, arbitrarily arranged, sub-micron optical tweezers, integrated with the QGM, via two methods, using: 1) a Digital Micromirror Device (i.e. holography), and 2) an acousto-optic deflector
              * Characterized a high (0.8) Numerical Aperture objective for the QGM using OSLO optical simulations and point-spread function image analysis in Python
              * Using an FPGA device, outputted RF waveforms that modulate laser beams with parabolic spatial intensity in order to produce a Bose-Einstein Condensate
              * Programmed FPGA and C electronic devices, and created and (3D) printed mechanical mounts and electronics circuits for experimental use

              * Interned at a software startup which has since been bought by Moka
              * Developed and deployed a location prediction SparkJava server with Cassandra and Redis databases
              * Implemented ML k-means clustering and SVM linear classification algorithms on location data
              * Wrote NodeJS servers and pages for receiving usersâ€™ predicted locations and displaying the live data on maps
              * Designed Cassandra and MySQL databases storing user tracking data, and wrote server APIs for accessing/updating, along with web panels for easy viewing of the data (using said APIs)
